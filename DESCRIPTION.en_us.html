    Caprasimo is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the ISO/IEC
    29500 standard by providing fallback for Cooper Black that minimizes text reflow in Office Open
    XML documents. Caprasimo is based on Fraunces, a display, old-style soft-serif
    typeface inspired by the mannerisms of early 20th century typefaces such as
    the Cooper Series. Fraunces was designed by Phaedra Charles and Flavia
    Zimbardi, partners at Undercase Type.
